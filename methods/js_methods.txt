Study site
The field site (Fig. 1) was within the Caribou-Poker Creek Research Watershed (CPCRW), which comprises a relatively pristine, ~100 km2 watershed ~45 km North of Fairbanks, AK; the CPCRW is part of the Bonanza Creek Long-Term Ecological Research site. In September 2013 twelve plots were established along a West-facing hill slope (Fig. 1) characterized by spatially continuous black spruce and underlain by permafrost. Four transects were established and each contained three plots across the hill-slope; plots were located so that each transect spanned gradients in active layer depth and tree stand structure (Fig. 2). Elevation was not constrained such that hill-slope positions are referred to here as low, middle, and high (Fig. 1). Active layer depth was estimated at each plot using a 110cm frost probe. To estimate tree-stand density, total basal area and mean diameter, the diameter at breast height (DBH) was recorded at each plot for all stems > 1cm DBH within a 5m radius; all stems > 1cm DBH were black spruce. The rate of CO2 efflux was measured in each plot using a PP-Systems EGM-4 connected to a PP-Systems Soil Respiration Chamber (SRC-1); 4-inch diameter soil collars made of PVC were installed to a depth of ~8cm and the SRC-1was used with these collars during sampling. This is a closed, re-circulating system that provided a flux rate estimate (g CO2 m-2 hr-1) using a quadratic fit to data collected over a two minute sampling period. Four soil collars were installed within each plot to generate four replicate flux rate estimates per plot; there were a total of 48 soil collars installed and most collars were used to estimate fluxes twice across a three-day period. For each flux measurement, temperature was measured at 5cm depth, 15cm depth, and in open air ~10cm above the land-surface.
